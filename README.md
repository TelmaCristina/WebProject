# Go Vegy

In this assignment I have created a web application used to add, delete or just edit vegetarian recipes! 
The main goal of the application is to have a space where you can keep your favorite recipes and share that with your friends.
The application gives you the chance not only to write down the ingredients and how to prepare it, but also it has a space to save a nice 
shot of your dish! 

## Technologies

The app was created using React, JavaScript, Axios CSS and Bulma. 

## How to get it running

Open this repository in GitPod and instal npm, node, axios and Bulma to get the full version of the application
```
install npm
install axios
install bulma
install node
```
When everything is installed, write the command bellow to run it
```
npm run dev
```
